# Project Title: Mental Health and Technology Usage Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the impact of technology usage on mental health using various data metrics such as screen time, sleep hours, physical activity, and more. The analysis is implemented in SQL and Power BI, showcasing skills in database management, data visualization, and analytical storytelling.

## Files and Structure
- **data/Database.csv**: The main dataset containing metrics on mental health, technology usage, and demographic information.
- **database/Schema.sql**: SQL schema defining the structure of the database tables and relationships.
- **reports/Dashboard.pbix**: Power BI dashboard that visualizes the key insights from the dataset.

## Getting Started
1. **SQL Analysis**: Load the schema and data into a MySQL or any compatible SQL database.
2. **Power BI Visualization**: Open `Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop to view and interact with the visualizations.

## Key Insights
- Highlight any interesting correlations found (e.g., high screen time correlating with lower sleep).
- Briefly describe each main visualization included in the Power BI report.

## Requirements
- Power BI Desktop
- SQL Database (e.g., MySQL)
